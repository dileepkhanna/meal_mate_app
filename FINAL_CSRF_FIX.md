# Final CSRF Fix for Railway Deployment

## ‚úÖ Code Updated!

I've updated your `settings.py` to properly handle CSRF trusted origins.

## üöÄ Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add meal_mate/settings.py
git commit -m "Fix CSRF trusted origins handling"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable in Railway

**Go to Railway Dashboard:**
1. Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click "Variables" tab
4. Add this variable:

```
Name:  CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS
Value: https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app
```

**IMPORTANT:** 
- Include `https://` in the value
- No trailing slash
- Exact URL: `https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app`

### Step 3: Wait for Automatic Redeploy

Railway will automatically redeploy when you:
1. Push to GitHub (triggers redeploy)
2. Add/change environment variables (triggers redeploy)

Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete.

### Step 4: Test

1. Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. Visit: https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app/signin/
3. Try to sign in
4. Should work! ‚úÖ

## üîç Verify Environment Variable is Set

```bash
railway variables
```

Should show:
```
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app
```

---

## üìã Complete Environment Variables Checklist

Make sure ALL of these are set in Railway:

```
SECRET_KEY=<your-generated-secret-key>
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<your-razorpay-key>
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<your-razorpay-secret>
```

**Note the differences:**
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` = `web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app` (NO https://)
- `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` = `https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app` (WITH https://)

## üêõ If Still Getting "Security token expired"

### Fix 1: Clear Browser Data
1. Open browser settings
2. Clear cookies and cache
3. Close and reopen browser
4. Try again

### Fix 2: Try Incognito Mode
1. Open incognito/private window
2. Visit your site
3. Try to sign in
4. If it works, clear your regular browser cache

### Fix 3: Check Railway Logs
```bash
railway logs --lines 100
```

Look for CSRF-related errors.

### Fix 4: Verify Variable is Set
```bash
railway variables | grep CSRF
```

Should show:
```
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app
```

### Fix 5: Force Redeploy
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

## üéØ Testing Checklist

After deploying, test these:

- [ ] Homepage loads: https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app/
- [ ] Sign in page loads: https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app/signin/
- [ ] Sign up page loads: https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app/signup/
- [ ] Can submit sign in form (no CSRF error)
- [ ] Can submit sign up form (no CSRF error)
- [ ] Can sign in successfully
- [ ] Can browse restaurants
- [ ] Can add to cart
- [ ] Can checkout

## üí° Why This Fix Works

### The Problem:
Django's CSRF protection requires that the request origin matches a trusted origin. In production (HTTPS), you must explicitly list your domain.

### The Old Code:
```python
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = os.environ.get('CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS', '').split(',') if os.environ.get('CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS') else []
```

This could create issues with empty strings or whitespace.

### The New Code:
```python
csrf_origins = os.environ.get('CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS', '')
if csrf_origins:
    CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [origin.strip() for origin in csrf_origins.split(',') if origin.strip()]
else:
    CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = []
```

This properly:
1. Gets the environment variable
2. Checks if it exists and is not empty
3. Splits by comma
4. Strips whitespace from each origin
5. Filters out empty strings
6. Creates a clean list
