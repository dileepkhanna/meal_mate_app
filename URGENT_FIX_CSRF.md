## üìû Quick Help

If you're still stuck, run this and share the output:

railway variables | grep CSRF

# Check logs for errors
railway logs --lines 50 | grep -i csrf

# Check deployment status
railway status
```

## üí° Why This Happened

Django's CSRF protection checks if the request origin matches trusted origins. In production (Railway), you must explicitly add your domain to `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`.

Your `settings.py` already has the code to read this variable:
```python
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = os.environ.get('CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS', '').split(',')
```

You just need to set it in Railway! üöÄ
