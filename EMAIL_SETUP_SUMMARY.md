# 📧 Email Setup Summary

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working:
- Forgot password feature is implemented
- Password reset links are generated
- Emails are being created

### ⚠️ What's Not Working:
- Emails only print to console/terminal
- Not sending to user's actual email address
- Need to configure email credentials

---

## Why Emails Aren't Sending

Currently using: `EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'`

But missing:
- ❌ `EMAIL_HOST_USER` (your email address)
- ❌ `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` (your app password)

**Result**: Authentication error when trying to send emails

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix (Choose One)

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Easiest) ⭐

```bash
python configure_email.py
```

This will:
1. Ask for your Gmail and App Password
2. Create `.env` file automatically
3. Configure everything for you

### Option 2: Manual Setup (5 minutes)

#### Get Gmail App Password:
1. https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. App passwords → Generate
4. Copy 16-character password

#### Update settings.py:
```python
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-16-char-password'
```

#### Test:
```bash
python test_email.py
```

- Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use regular Gmail password
- Commit credentials to Git
- Share your App Password
- Hardcode passwords in code

---

## 📊 Configuration Options

### Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended)

Create `.env` file:
```
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

Install python-decouple:
```bash
pip install python-decouple
```

Update settings.py:
```python
from decouple import config

EMAIL_HOST_USER = config('EMAIL_HOST_USER', default='')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = config('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD', default='')
```

### Option B: Direct Configuration (Quick Test)

Update settings.py:
```python
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'
```

⚠️ Don't commit this to Git!
