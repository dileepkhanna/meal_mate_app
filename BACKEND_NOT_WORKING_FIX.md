# Generate new SECRET_KEY
python generate_secret_key.py

# In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables, add:
SECRET_KEY=(new generated key)
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://web-production-9d6bf.up.railway.app
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=(your key)
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=(your secret)
```

### Step 3: Deploy Fresh
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh deployment"
git push origin main

# Railway will auto-deploy
```

### Step 4: Run Setup Commands
